## Questions and answers

### What do you think the people of the team do well, and should keep doing?

 * It's always a pleasure to work with everyone in the team!
 * Help each other and do not prioritize making progress over helping
 * Yes, they are all kind and patient.

### What do you think the people of the team could do better?

 * It would be good practice to make sure your branch is ready to work on (no uncommitted stuff, unresolved merged conflict etx.) before joining the session. We sometimes lose a lot of time to these issues instead of programming. 
 * Focus on merging to keep project cohesion
 * I know the better way to master something is to start doing it, but I do think some clear and basic guides matter.

## How do you think the workflow of the team can be improved?

## What do you think is good about the monthly mob programming sessions?

 * I love that we can interrupt to ask questions, and I feel the frequency of the sessions is ideal.
 * Very good
 * I don't know what is the monthly mob programming sessions, I can't tell.

## How do you think the monthly mob programming sessions can be improved?

 * They are very good
 * Ask members to provide Richel with ideas of issues / topics 
   to work on a bit ahead (1 hour before?) of the session? 
  Ofc Richel should always be free to decide what he will work on :)

## What do you think is good about the monthly C++ Core Guideline of the Month?

 * Everything
 * Straight to the point
 * Is it the 5 minutes by Richel before we start working. 
   If it is, then I think it's too short.

## How do you think the monthly C++ Core Guideline of the Month can be improved?

 * Maybe we could keep track of the guidelines that were 
   discussed in the past somewhere in a .md or a Discord channel? with links to the corresponding sections in the book.
 * Perhaps doing some live programming with a minimal example 
   (also easy to understand by newbies)
 * I think the time for it can be prolonged.

## What do you think is good about the monthly Project Update?

 * I like to keep in touch with part of the project 
   that I do not work on
 * Don't know what the monthly project update is.

### How do you think the monthly Project Update can be improved?

 * There should be some minimal preparation so that it can truly benefit team members

### What do you think is good, but not covered here?

 * Task forces

### How do you think can be improved, but is not covered by the other questions?

 * Have some kind of roadmap and focus/priority
 * Maybe it would be time to settle on a name for the game? 
   Also, we should start a pyramid scheme to get more people in the team

### Do you think we should start on a new game after the Summer holiday?

 * No, I would like to continue working on this game
 * No, I would like to continue working on this game
 * No, I would like to continue working on this game

### Do you intend to continue with tresinformal after the Summer holiday?

 * Yes
 * Yes
 * Yes

### What do you enjoy about this type of this evaluation?

 * Can do it at my own time
 * I enjoy that it's (only?) as long to fill as we want it to be, 
   and that there is room to answer extra questions or not answer some of them
 * Asking what can be improved. I don't have any complaints about it, 
   but it's good to see that the group is always preparing to be improved. :) 

### How would you have preferred to do such an evaluation?

 * preferred to do it face to face, one person at a time, less anonymous
 * this way is fine.
