# Fairytale (For ages 3.14159 to 265358 years old)

Once upon a time there was a dragon, a toothfairy and a goblin.
They were both horses in disguise (can you imagine?)!

Three fairytale protagonists in two horse bodies, what a quantum conundrum.

They drank a lot of beer and flew into the sun, that was a white dwarf.

The sun was very hot and would burn anything and anyone to a crisp, but as they are magical creatures, they were not harmed.
They flew right through it and back into darkness.


They flew back to earth.
and they lived happily ever after (maybe).

Which is troublesome as it was winter and they were in North Finland...
and they lived happily until their livers collapsed. Ande even then, they were happy.


Until the universe aged and entropy ripped the rest of 
their bodies apart and shredded them to bits like shredded wheat!

Anticlimcatic you may think But wait till you hear what happened next.....

Climate change!!! The weather of North Finland became comparable to Southern France and alcohol having a low boiling temperature, all the beer evaporated. The continents were united again as the sea level receded... but despite of this all of the king's dragons and tooth fairies could not put the horses back together again.

the story continues to the galaxy far far away
dragons have been living on the earth's plane of existance, but the empire is invading earth with Darth Vader leading the army. brave dragons have once again stood up together, shoulder to shoulder to protect and save the humanity from the evil empire. They were fighting for 60 days and 80 nights in succession and in the end... 
They lost. They lost?!

The penguins were pleased when news reached them about the events. They had been expecting this for a while.

They all died of climate change.

Suddenly, a herd of minimammoths appeared. 
Due to the sun, they were killed by the heat. 
But that is not all of it! Because they were actually robot scouts from the future. And suddenly a time portal opened up and a load of robots appeared!
"Help!!!" A dead penguin screamed.
