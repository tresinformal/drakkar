# 20211215_retrospective

## Richel's interpretation

This was the first time we did a Retrospective (capital 'R' because
it is An Official Thing). My favorite thing: I do not need to
copy evalution results and we have Action Items:

 * One week, pair with someone that knows more, the week after pair with
   someone that knows less

This is hard to make a schedule of.
For example, based on the [GitHub Contributor Rank](https://github.com/tresinformal/game/graphs/contributors)
this would be a format:

GHCR|Odd weeks|Even weeks
----|---------|----------
1   |Teach    |Teach    
2   |Learn    |Teach    
3   |Teach    |Learn    
4   |Learn    |Teach    
5   |Teach    |Learn    
6   |Learn    |Teach    
7   |Teach    |Learn    
8   |Learn    |Teach    
9   |Learn    |Learn    

Drawback (or isn't it?) is that the team gets to know one another slower;
they only meet the people with around the same number of commits.

Also, some people want to be excluded to work on their own once in a while.

 * Get more people in the team

Hard to achieve, I would be open to more suggestions.

 * Monthly C++ core guideline - How to's, max 5 mins

I added this to the schedule as a Monthly event on Discord.
