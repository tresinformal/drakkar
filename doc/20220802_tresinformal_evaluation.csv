It's always a pleasure to work with everyone in the team!,"It would be good practice to make sure your branch is ready to work on (no uncommitted stuff, unresolved merged conflict etx.) before joining the session. We sometimes lose a lot of time to these issues instead of programming. ",,,,,,,,,"I love that we can interrupt to ask questions, and I feel the frequency of the sessions is ideal.",Ask members to provide Richel with ideas of issues / topics to work on a bit ahead (1 hour before?) of the session? Ofc Richel should always be free to decide what he will work on :),Straight to the point,Maybe we could keep track of the guidelines that were discussed in the past somewhere in a .md or a Discord channel? with links to the corresponding sections in the book.,,,,"Maybe it would be time to settle on a name for the game? Also, we should start a pyramid scheme to get more people in the team %)","No, I would like to continue working on this game",yes,"I enjoy that it's (only?) as long to fill as we want it to be, and that there is room to answer extra questions or not answer some of them",

I don't have any complaints about it, but it's good to see that the group is always preparing to be improved. :) ",this way is fine.
